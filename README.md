# Renamer_of_files
I've downloaded 2pac's  albums, but all songs had a name, which was looking like this: "2pac - *.mp3". That was annoying, so I wanted to remove "2pac - " part from all names.

I wrote this programm.
Firstly, you have to input full path to dir, which contains albums(variable path_to_albums) and album names(array albums[]), 
than you enter the number of first chars you want remove from the filenames(variable number_of_chars). In our case it is 7("2pac - ") .

That's all. Compile and run.
