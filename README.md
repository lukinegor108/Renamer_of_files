# Renamer_of_files
I've downloaded 2pac's  albums, but all songs had a name, which was looking like this: "2pac - *.mp3". That was annoying, so I wanted to remove "2pac - " part from all names.

I had few albums there. In "renamer_of_files.cpp" you can write the path to dir with your albums. Make sure, that all songnames have the same pattern(in my case "2pac - *.mp3"), or you'll spoil some of the songnames.
And make sure, that the dir with albums contains only the albums, or you'll spoil other files in that dir.

Use "number_of_chars" variable to change number of chars, which will be erased(in my case that was: "2pac - " - 7 chars).

That's all. Compile and run.
